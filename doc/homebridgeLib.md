## Introduction
While developing a number of [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugins, I find myself duplicating a lot of code.
The idea behind this library is to ease developing and maintaining Homebridge plugins by separating this generic code, dealing with [HomeKit](http://www.apple.com/ios/home/) and Homebridge, from the specific code, dealing with the actual devices being exposed to HomeKit.

Technically, the Homebridge Lib library is based on the following starting points:
- Using the Homebridge [dynamic platform plugin API](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/wiki/On-Programming-Dynamic-Platforms);
- Using JavaScript [asynchronous functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) rather than callbacks;
- Using JavaScript [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) rather than prototypes.  An actual plugin would extend the classes provided by Homebridge Lib;
- Using NodeJS [events](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/events.html).  In fact all Homebridge Lib delegate classes extend `EventEmitter`;
- Using the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/standard/standard);
- Using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) for API documentation;
- Using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) for automated testing of the generic utilities.

### Abstract Superclasses
The Homebridge Lib library provides a number of abstract superclasses for a Homebridge dynamic platform plugin and for delegates to a HomeKit accessory, service, and characteristic.

Class                          | Description
------------------------------ | -----------
{@link Platform}               | Homebridge dynamic platform plugin.
{@link AccessoryDelegate}      | Delegate of a HomeKit accessory.
{@link ServiceDelegate}        | Delegate of a HomeKit service.
{@link CharacteristicDelegate} | Delegate of a HomeKit characteristic.
{@link Delegate}               | Abstract superclass for {@link Platform}, {@link AccessoryDelegate}, {@link ServiceDelegate}, and {@link CharacteristicDelegate}.

These delegate classes provide the following functionality:
- Saving and restoring accessories from persistent storage between Homebridge sessions (using the Homebridge dynamic platform API);
- History for [Eve](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-app);
- Universal Plug & Play (UPnP) device discovery;
- Setting up a heartbeat for device polling;
- Logging and error handling;
- Checking the NodeJS and Homebridge versions used;
- Checking the latest plugin version published to the NPM registry.

A Homebridge plugin based on Homebridge Lib extends these classes, providing the device-specific logic.
See [`homebridge-ws`](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-ws) for an example plugin based on Homebridge Lib.

### API Wrapper
The Homebridge Lib library provides a wrapper around the remaining Homebride and [HAP-NodeJS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS) APIs, that cannot be hidden by the abstract superclasses.

Class       | Description
----------- | -----------
{@link hap} | HomeKit Accessory Protocol.
{@link eve} | Custom HomeKit services and characteristic used by the [Eve](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-app) app.
{@link my}  | Custom HomeKit services and characteristics used by [my plugins](https://github.com/ebaauw?tab=repositories).

### Command-Line Utilities
The Homebridge Lib library comes with a number of command-line tools for troubleshooting Homebridge installations.

Tool    | Description
------- | -----------
`hap`   | Logger for HomeKit accessory announcements.
`json`  | JSON formatter.
`upnp`  | Logger for UPnP device announcements.

Each command-line tool takes a `-h` or `--help` argument to provide a brief overview of its functionality and command-line arguments.

### Utility Classes
The Homebridge Lib library provides a number of utility classes for Homebridge plugins and/or command-line tools.

Class                      | Description
-------------------------- | -----------
{@link AdaptiveLighting}   | Adaptive Lighting.
{@link Colour}             | Colour conversions.
{@link CommandLineParser}  | Parser and validator for command-line arguments.
{@link CommandLineTool}    | Command-line tool.
{@link CustomHomeKitTypes} | Abstract superclass for {@link EveHomeKitTypes} and {@link MyHomeKitTypes}.
{@link EveHomeKitTypes}    | Custom HomeKit Services and Characteristic used by [Eve](https://www.evehome.com/en) accessories and by the [Eve app](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-app).
{@link HttpClient}         | HTTP client.
{@link JsonFormatter}      | JSON formatter.
{@link MyHomeKitTypes}     | My own collection of custom HomeKit Services and Characteristics.
{@link OptionParser}       | Parser and validator for options and other parameters.
{@link UpnpClient}         | Universal Plug and Play client.
